Android Radio Streaming App github example by ercan duman

This Radio application checks internet connection as well. If there is no connection, it shows some TOAST message such as:

If there is internet connection; the application show a dialog while trying to connect the stream url
(Loading, please wait...)

When finished, it plays radio...

And seekbar listens device volume button's events, when volume down pressed the seekbar volume goes down too, and vice versa...

This app plays stream urls from the internet, with this basic idea, if you like, you can add more radio stations...

Hope it helps someone :+1: :) If you want to see some real project I have created with android radio streaming, 
please have a look on my android [RadiOom ]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ercanduman.radioom&hl=en) application.
